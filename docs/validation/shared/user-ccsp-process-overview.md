## CCSP Validation Process Overview <a name="process"></a>

This section describes the steps of the process when submiting the results to Red Hat Partner Program.
If the goal is not sharing the results to Red Hat, you can go to the next section.

Overview of the process to apply the results to the Red Hat Partner support case:

0. Install an OpenShift cluster on **the version desired** to be validated
1. Prepare the OpenShift cluster to run the validated environment
2. Download and install the OPCT
3. Run the OPCT
4. Monitor tests 
5. Gather results
6. Share the results archive with Red Hat Partner support case

It's not uncommon for specific tests to occasionally fail.  As a result, you may be asked by Support Engineers to repeat the process a few times depending on the results.

Finally, you will be asked to manually upgrade the cluster to the next minor release.

More detail on each step can be found in the sections further below.
