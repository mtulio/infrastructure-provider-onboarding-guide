# Welcome

This site contains documentation about how to add a new infrastructure provider
to the OpenShift platform using either a full integration, or by extending it with
Platform External (OpenShift 4.14+).

To begin learning about the process, please see the following pages according to your
goal:

- [Full Integration](overview.md): to completely onboard the provider into OpenShift codebase
- [Platform External](platform-external/index.md): to extend OpenShift pplatform by providing
  custom components like CCM (Cloud Controller Manager)
