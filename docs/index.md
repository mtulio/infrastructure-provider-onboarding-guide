# Welcome

This site contains documentation about how to add a new infrastructure provider
to the OpenShift platform by either delivering platform-specific automation
and components as a bundled part of OpenShift, or as independent extensions
that are maintained separately using the external platform type (OpenShift 4.14+).

To begin learning about the process, please see the following pages according to your
goal:

- [Platform External](platform-external/index.md): to extend OpenShift platform by providing
  custom components like CCM (Cloud Controller Manager)
- [Platform-specific integration](overview.md): to completely onboard the provider into OpenShift codebase
